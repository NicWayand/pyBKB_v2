# Creates a .csv file of a point's temperature, dewpoint, u and v wind, and wind speed
# in the HRRR model

## TO DO: for fires that have been burning for a while, check if the 
##        .csv file exists, if it does, then we already have some data.
##        Read the last line, figure out the last date, and begin from that time.
